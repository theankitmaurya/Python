"""
Python Decorators -> Python decorators are a powerful and versatile tool that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. they are a way to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its source code.
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function. The new function is often referred to as a "decorated" function.

Syntax ->
@decorator_function
def my_function():
    pass
    
The @decorator_function notation is just a shorthand for the following code:
def my_function():
    pass
my_function = decorator_function(my_function)

Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions and methods, such as logging, memoization and access control.
"""

def greet(fx):
    def mfx():
        print("Good Morning")
        fx()
        print("Thanks for using this function")
    return mfx

@greet
def hello():
    print("Hello World")

hello()

"""
One common use of decorators is to add logging to a function. For example, we could use a decorator to log the arguments and return value of a function each time it is called.
"""

import logging

def log_function_call(func):
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        logging.info(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args = {args}, kwargs = {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        logging.info(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return decorated

@log_function_call
def my_function(a, b):
    return a + b


"""
In this example, the log_function_call decorator takes function as an argument and returns a new function that logs the function call before and after the original function is called.
"""

"""
Conclusion -> Decorators are a powerful and flexible feature in Python that can be used to add functionality to functions and methods without modifying their source code. They are a great tool for separating concerns, reducing code duplication, and making our code more readable and maintainable.
In conclusion, python decorators are a way to extend the functionality of functions and methods, by modifying its behavior without modifying source code. They are used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, memoization, access control and more. They are a powerful tool that can be used to make our code more readable, maintainable and extendable.
