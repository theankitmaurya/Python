# Python Comments - A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

Escape Sequence Characters - 
To insert characters that cannot directly used i a string, we use an escape sequence character.

An escape sequence character is a backslash followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
print("This doesnt "execute")
# print("This will execute")
"""

print("This will \"execute")
