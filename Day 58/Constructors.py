"""
Constructors -> A constructor is a special method in a class used to create and initialize an object of a class. There are different types of constructors. Constructor is invoked automatically when an object of a class is created.

A constructor is a unique function that gets called automatically when an object is created of a class. The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize or assign values to the data members of that class. It cannot return any value other than None.

Syntax of Python Constructor ->
def __init__(self):
    # initializations

init is one of the reserved functions in Python. In Object Oriented Programming, it is known as constructor.

    def __init__(self, name, occ):

        self.occ = occ

    def info(self):

a = Person("Anmol", "Student")
b = Person("Ankit", "Software Developer")

a.info()
b.info()

Types of Constructors in Python ->
1. Parametrized Constructor
2. Default Constructor

"""
Parametrized Constructor in Python -> When the constructor accepts arguments along with self, it is known as parametrized constructor.
These arguments can be used inside the class to assign the values to the data members.
